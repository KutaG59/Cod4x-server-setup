# Cod4x-server-setup
This is just a repository for Cod4x (Cod4 PC client) to help setup a server. Click on the "server.cfg" above README.md or below. All settings are there besides some modes I believe. 

Any questions/issues feel free to contact me on discord as I rarely look at github Discord: Kutag9


I will soon add a server setup guide for Linux, I use Fedora 39, keep that in mind if you are waiting for a guide, as all commands will use dnf and such. Or follow the guide on Cod4x Github if you are experienced with Linux.
